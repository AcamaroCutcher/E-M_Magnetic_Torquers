Greetings,
This is my first day trying to make this simulation code to work. I will be trying to follow some tutorial and some info for Claude. I am unsure how to go about this so this is interesting.
I hope that I can develop the math/physics code from scratch and be able to use a library to draw the planet and the satellite on to the screen.
